About
This project contains a simple RESTful POST API that accepts two matrices and returns the product of the two matrices. The main aim of this project is to get hands on with Docker and Kubernetes. An image of this API 
was created and added to a deployment file which was created within the Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes cluster was created using NECTAR. After the image was deployed in order to expose it publicly we created a 
service configuration that contains an IP and a PORT to communicate with public traffic
